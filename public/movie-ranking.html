<h2> TOP 3 BEST</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Attack On Titan</h3>
    <p> It was scary in a good way. Kinda liked that guy, what's his name? Levi? Short but so agile</p>
<h3>Demon Slayer</h3>
    <p>Such beautiful imager and it was so thrilling. Kept me at the edge of my seat!</p>
<h3>King the land</h3>
    <p> Just the romance, intimacy between Gu and Sarang. Made me swoon everytime</p>
