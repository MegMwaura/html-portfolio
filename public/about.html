<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> My name's Megan and I love God.</p>

<p>All I want is to live in His perfect will for my life.</p>

<p> And I'm learning web development with Angela Yu's course. I know a few things about creating websites from scratch but this course is so eye-opening and fun! Makes me realize some mistakes I was making in the past. </p>

<p>This is such an amazing opportunity, can't wait to learn more!

Thank you for taking time to look at this, it'll be better the next time you're here
